## Output and Correctness

The output and correctness of each algorithm – You should summarize, visualize, or highlight some part of the full-scale run of each algorithm. Additionally, the report should briefly describe what tests you performed to confirm that each algorithm was working as intended.

## Answer to Leading Question

The answer to your leading question – You should direct address your proposed leading question. How did you answer this question? What did you discover? If your project was ultimately unsuccessful, give a brief reflection about what worked and what you would do differently as a team.

For reference, our leading question is included below:

### Leading Question 
We will examine a network generated using email data from a large European research institution. We have anonymized information about all incoming and outgoing email between members of the research institution, along with the department IDs of invidual members.
We are interested in seeing how emails demonstrate relationships within an organization and the amount of communication within research institution. This will allow us to analyze the interconnectedness of departments and indivduals, which may be useful in tracking mutually influential interactions within academia. We want to find the shortest email path between two inputted users and the number of connected components within an inputted department to see how centralized department communication is. We also want to identify if the email connections graph can be called Eulerian, as an additional challenge and exercise.
