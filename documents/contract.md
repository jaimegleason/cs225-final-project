#Team Contract
##Communication
Team Meetings: Our team will meet once a week every Wednesday and Saturday from 5:30-6:30 in person. Jaimecg2 will be our designated note taker, Notes will be stored on a Google document, time-stamped for each meeting. We will work together to complete the weekly development log. 

Assistance: Each team member can be contacted through text and Discord. Outside of emergencies or other commitments, we commit to responding to messages within 48 hours.

Respect: All decisions will be accepted by simple majority – while unanimous agreement is preferred, it is not required. By signing this document, each member of the team commits to adhering to the decisions made, even if they personally disagree with them.

##Collaboration
Work Distribution: Each week, the necessary delivarables for the week will be determined by the full team and each member will volunteer to work on one or more deliverables. When no one volunteers, two team members will be randomly assigned to work on the task as a paired-programming team. If this leads to an unbalanced workload for the week, adjustments can be made on a case by case basis.

Time Commitment: To ensure an equal distribution of work, each member is expected to independently work no less than two and no more than six hours per week on the project. If a deliverable ends up taking more time, the rest of the team should be pulled in to assist with the unforseen complication, with each member taking an equal share of the workload or programming in pairs. It is the team’s responsibility, not the individual’s responsibility, to make sure a weekly deliverable is finished by the end of the week.

However if a team member is habitually not completing their tasks, they may be asked – politely – to explain their circumstances. Based on their explanation further actions, such as alerting a staff member, may be taken on a case by case basis decided by the other team members.

Conflict Resolution: All conflicts within the team will be decided by the Snake game, whoever gets the highest score wins. The winner will decide who was right and who was wrong (Might makes right).
